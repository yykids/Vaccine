    * Debian/Ubuntu: Execute apt-get remove ds-agent 

#### For Windows 
* Access instance and delete vaccine agent. 
    * On Programs and Features, delete **Trend Micro Deep Security Agent**.

2\. Deliver Analysis Files 

* To analyze causes to prevent recurrence, collect files of the following paths and request to Customer Center for analysis.  
    * Linux
        * Execute /opt/ds_agent/dsa_control -d 
        * Request for analysis of /var/opt/ds_agent/diag/random 10-digit numbers.zip file 
    * Windows
        * Execute C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Deep Security Agent\dsa_control -d 
        * Request for analysis of C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Deep Security Agent\diag\random 10-digit numbers. zip file 
* To analyze in more details, when an issue occurs, you may perform debugging first and request for more created files.

### User Guide for Image Replication 

This guide regards to using vaccines for the creation of private image-based instances, including vaccine agents. 

* Access instance, and install each script by creation or execution. 
* Following the guide to enable vaccine agents, click Refresh and **Start Service** on the service page. 

※ Caution 

* Change Appkey of "group:Appkey" in the script, into that of **URL & Appkey** on the service page. 
* For unwanted replication instances, it is recommended to delete installed agents so as not to waste unnecessary resources.   
* After 'Start Service', the service status immediately enables 'Close Service', but vaccines start to operate in no more than 10 minutes, like the initial installation.
